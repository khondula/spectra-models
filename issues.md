# spectra-models

Notes

## todo 

* FLNT - chl AOS data plots (no total chl a, handle replicates)
* rerun PRLA and PRPO for chl AOS data (with replicate handling)
* FLNT AOS vs AIS - duplicate rows for tsibble matching?
* min detection limits (eg for iron)
* precip data
* figure out units for comparing suna and AOS
* extract radiance spectra
* geomorph map of each site with locations? 
* map band ratios
* make ternary plot
* expand to inlet, outlet, reach, riparian sampling points

## data issues

* what is the source of PRLA QFs in 2020 
* PRPO fDOM really weird looking in 2019
* FLNT negative SUNA values in 2018
* FLNT 2018 turbidity quality flag issues (negative values)
* CRAM 2020 not extracted

## methods questions

* algal analysis methods when NA for algalAnalysisMethod - what can be used to calculate relative abundance?
